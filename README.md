## [Predicting the Success Rate of Video Ads](https://github.com/buseOzr/PredictingtheSuccessRate)

### Abstract
With the extensive usage of video ads in the digital advertising industry,
achieving a high success rate of video-based advertisements has gained significant importance
in the ad tech industry. Hence it is essential to deliver video advertisements to end-users
seamlessly. SSPs need to choose the best advertiser per auction whose ads can
be delivered without having problems on the corresponding publisherâ€™s website. These
problems could be raised due to time-out, internet connection problem, non-compliant
video format, and incompatibility between publishers and advertisers.
However, ad tech companies want to prevent this obstacle in order to serve the best
experience to end-users, to give substantial benefit to advertisers, to increase the revenue
of publishers and the regarding ad server company because if an ad is served on the serverside,
though it fails on the client-side, it is not exposed to an end-user. Consequently,
there is no revenue either for a publisher or an ad server. Moreover, the advertiser is not
able to show its content to a user. This situation is undesirable for all parties. __Therefore
this study proposes a methodology that builds a machine learning model in order to
predict the success rate of video ads for given constraints, compare the state-of-the-art approaches and improve them progressively__
. This method helps SSPs to calculate the expected revenue of each bidder in an auction. By doing so, the ad server
chooses a bidder with the highest expected revenue. Consequently, SSPs can
increase the success/delivery rate of video ads and its revenue.
